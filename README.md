# ‚ö†Ô∏è Bugs

Don't expect the script to be perfect, of course there's gonna be some bugs in it so if you see any then please contact [@wasthattoomuchforyou](https://t.me/wasthattoomuchforyou) or [@loficat](https://t.me/loficat). Send us a video of the bug so we know how to fix it.

## üåÄ What It Does

- Larps your favourite Minecraft username on Lunar Client.
- Shows your skin aswell
- Can also join servers (cracked only)

## üõ† Install

1. Install Python, I assume any version should be fine. But, Python 3.10 is recommended since I'm using it aswell.
2. Run the Python installer, make sure to check "Add Python 3.XX to PATH". Then, click on "Customize installation" and check the "pip" option.
3. Press "Next", then press "Install" and when it's done installing the close the installer.
4. Download "minecraft.py" from this GitHub, or make a text and edit using Notepad or Visual Studio Code. If you're editing directly, then just go to the minecraft.py file and click on "Raw" then copy the whole thing and paste it into the file and save.
5. Run it, there's gonna be four options. But since you're here to larp, you're gonna wanna choose option 1.
6. Now enter an username, something like "larpforfree", "debug", or "Fox" (don't let debug know that you're larping as him).
7. Now, go to [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) and look for the username that you wanna larp. Go to the profile, copy the UUID and paste it in the console and press Enter.
8. It should work, go to your launcher and launch the game. Also, if you want the username to show up in the launcher then you would wanna have a premium Minecraft account (an actual account) logged in first.
9. Launch the game, any version will be fine. Make a singleplayer, go in third person to see your username and skin. Or you can also join cracked servers to larp better.
